# GUI Quiz Application (Open Trivia Database)
A graphical quiz application built with Python and Tkinter that tests your knowledge with True/False questions fetched live from the Open Trivia Database (OpenTDB).

## Description
This project provides an interactive quiz experience within a graphical user interface (GUI). On launch, it dynamically fetches 10 True/False trivia questions from the Open Trivia Database API. 
The application presents questions one by one, allows the user to answer via "True" or "False" buttons, provides feedback on the answer, and keeps track of the user's score.
